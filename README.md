Rainy days
I'm thinking 'bout you
What to say
Wish I knew how to
Find the way
Right back to you
On rainy days like
Rainy days
I'm thinking 'bout you
What to say
Wish I knew how to
Find the way
Right back to you
On rainy days like
Staring at my phone
난 깨있지
Hoping for your call lately
I've been on my own maybe
이젠 지난
일에 맨날
Time with you was so amazing
Haven't changed it's still the
same me
늦었지만 우리 다시
Can we go back to that moment
again yeah
Rainy days
I'm thinking 'bout you
What to say
Wish I knew how to
Find the way
Right back to you
On rainy days like
Rainy days
I'm thinking 'bout you
What to say
Wish I knew how to
Find the way
Right back to you
On rainy days like
Remember how I used to make you
laugh the most
내가 이런 말 할 자격 없어도
Let me make up for all
the time we lost
We can start again,
open all the doors
Don't tell me it’s over
We can start it over
너는 나의 네 잎 clover
Yeah, I can feel your touch
I remember your kiss
그 말은 아팠지
And I miss you
Rainy days
I'm thinking 'bout you
What to say
Wish I knew how to
Find the way
Right back to you
On rainy days like
Rainy days
I'm thinking 'bout you
What to say
Wish I knew how to
Find the way
Right back to you
On rainy days like
